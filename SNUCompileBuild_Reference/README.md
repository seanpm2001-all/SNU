# SNU Compile and build Gist - Local reference

This directory contains the current versions of the SNUCompileAndBuild Gist for users who don't have an Internet connection at the time, want an offline copy, or have another reason to want to see this Gist offline.

I only am adding in old versions (this includes the latest releeas as well, they are just labeled old versions)

This Gist gives lots of helpful info on building and compiling SNU and using the SNU module system, plus maintaining your SNU distribution.
